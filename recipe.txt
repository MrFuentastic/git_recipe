French Toast!

This is a recipe for french toast, the only pastry like breakfast (pancakes, crepes are other examples of pastry like breakfasts) that matters. Breakfast SHOULD have plenty of protein, but I suppose french toast can pass as it contains eggs.

Ingredients:
2 eggs
2/3 cup milk
some cinnamon
tiny bit nutmeg
slices bread(recommend croissant, or thick slices of white bread)

Directions:
-Heat up a large skillet and toss some buttah on there (you better be using butter)
-Add eggs and milk together into a mixing bowl, whisk them (side to side! all other whisking methods are inferior! its been proven by science!)
