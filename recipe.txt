French Toast!

This is a recipe for french toast, the only pastry like breakfast (pancakes, crepes are other examples of pastry like breakfasts) that matters. Breakfast SHOULD have plenty of protein, but I suppose french toast can pass as it contains eggs.

Ingredients:
2 eggs
2/3 cup milk
some cinnamon
tiny bit nutmeg
slices bread(recommend croissant, or thick slices of white bread)
